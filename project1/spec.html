                <h2>Top-Rated Outback</h2>
                <figure id="car-1"><img src="media/images/car-1.png" alt="Subaru Outback"></figure>
                <p>I just found another good reason to appreciate my Outback Wagon! Based on the annual vehicle insurance ratings from my auto
                    insurer, the Outbacks (2002-2005 models) are among those top-rated cars on its Liability Rating Index, Vehicle Safety
                    Discount and Damage & Theft Index. I feel so wonderful that my car is among some Audis, BMWs, Mercedes, Saabs and Volvos
                    for some measures.

                <h2>First Love</h2>
                <p>I finally bought my first new car - and it's a Subaru! I love it!<br>
                    My first Subaru experience was in 1970, as a poor college student. My girlfriend loaned me an older Subaru car. I call it a
                    car, but it barely sat two people. It was so tiny, with 10-inch wheels, perhaps 10 feet long.</p>

                    <p>But it had a two-stroke engine that got about 50 miles to the gallon, and it was so much fun to drive! Do you recall these 
                    vehicles?

                <p>As I was driving home, I noticed the rainbow and had to stop to take a few pictures.<br>
                    My WRX takes me safely through mud, under the rain, to the end of the rainbow!<br>
