    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <h3>Important Links</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="src/subaru-1.pdf">Original Reference PDF</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If I'm going to use something like this for a portfolio, I'm going to need an ungodly amount of breakpoints just to prevent
            the inline images from going haywire.
        </li>
        <li>I'm also probably gonna drop the text wrap around the icons, since I'm gonna be using primarily rectangular images,
            and also it behaves kinda janky sometimes and I'm really not a fan.
        </li>
        <li>I hope I won't lose points for the text not flowing exactly as the PDF does!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Part 2</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Baloo Bhai 2, Harmattan fonts: Google Fonts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>(Prototype) I wish I had more time to work on this, but I've been juggling 4 different projects including this one all week. I need to make a new header and work on 
            responsiveness, and I will next week once 2 of my other projects are done and I have time to breathe and work on this one.</li>
        <li>(Prototype) I don't know why the Bootstrap Carousel looks the way it does, the buttons shouldnt be half-opaque. I'll fix it sometime.</li>
        <li>(Final) Fixed the strange behavior of the carousel buttons, should work just fine now.</li>
        <li>(Final) Also, finally changed the header to add my name and portrait, as well as changed fonts to be more pleasant to look at.</li>
    </ul>
