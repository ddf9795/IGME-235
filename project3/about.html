    <h1>Project 3 Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Title: QUIKKSTEP</h2>
    <p>Concept: An auto-runner styled game where the player character runs from side-to-side across the horizontal plane, bouncing back in the opposite direction when they reach the 
        opposite end of the screen. The player has obstacles they are meant to dodge sent at them in the opposing direction, and the player is meant to dodge them by "quickstepping" 
        (snapping up or down to another preset y-level) out of the way. It's a high score oriented game, with a scaling difficulty method of throwing more projectiles at the player
        over time, but with increasing the score rewarded as it gets more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>Genres: Endless Runner, Action</p>
    <p>Platform: Desktop Web</p>
    <p>Story: No real story, kinda just abstract</p>
    <p>Aesthetics: Unsure yet, but maybe something super minimal and abstract and dystopian, maybe like The Cube movie from 1997 but way simpler. Just spitballing though</p>
    <p>Gameplay: The player will have no control over their horizontal movement, but will be able to control themselves on the vertical axis by snapping themselves to one of a set of
        predefined y-axes.

    <img width="600" height="300" src="media/mockups/movement mockup.png" al="Rough movement mockup">
    <p>Other: The game will likely be made in PixiJS and HTML; unsure about the alternative of using the DOM though, I will look into it further to see what'll be best for this
        project.

    <h2>Development progress: Prototype</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The basic gameplay loop has been completed. No sound yet, and on semi-rare occasion you get a BS death, but its functional and decently fun as a little
            time waster.
        </li>
        <li>As of right now, the sprites are temporary.</li>
        <li>I also set up some basic CSS, centering it in the center of the page with a dotted border and a bit of a softer shade of very light grey as the background color.</li>
        <li>In the process of making the CSS, I got the amazing idea of making it look kinda like one of those old dot matrix games. That probably is a bit much
            to go for this late in development though. Maybe I can go for a WonderSwan look? I'll think on it.
        </li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Development progress: Final</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I wasn't thinking of WonderSwan, I was just thinking of the Scale2x filter, lol. Made some new sprites and filtered them through that. Also made some SFX
            using jsfxr and got a nice royalty free chiptune loop playing in the background.
        </li>
        <li>I implemented a prevention measure for later intensities and the possibility of obstacles spawning on top of you. At all points in the game, there's a threshold
            at the edges of the screen where obstacle spawning is disabled to prevent unfair moments where something spawns directly on top of you with no way to react.
            As the intensity increases and the player speeds up, this threshold will get incrementally larger to address the fact that the player may get fast enough to surpass
            the threshold before the spawn check goes through, causing unfair spawns to occur anyways. In extreme edgecases, at ludicrously high intensities the thresholds
            will overlap and cover the entire playspace, but at that point the player would be already pinging back and forth between existing obstacles with inhuman reaction times, so I don't see a problem
            with it.
        </li>
        <li>I also implemented some measures to prevent legitimate loss-states that just feel unfair, such as trying to dodge an obstacle but being just too late and
            dying as the very fringes of the sprites connect, or trying to weave between obstacles and hitting one by accident. These may be techincally deserved
            failures, but they feel terrible. I added both an invulnerability state for when the player moves, giving them 8 frames of invulnerability for a bit of
            leniency when it comes to situations like weaving, as well as a collision timer. With this timer, the player does not instantly lose upon impact with an
            obstacle; rather, a 5 frame timer starts, and if 5 frames pass and collision is still occurring, THEN the player dies. This is for scenarios such as
            avoiding obstacles by the skin of your teeth, since you did technically connect, and you should have lost, but that wouldn't have felt fair, so you get a pass.
        </li>
        <li>The addition of these invuln states did open up the door for an exploit, where endlessly spamming up and down would have given the player infinite
            invulnerability, negating all challenge, so I had to implement some logic to try and counter this. It isn't foolproof and it may not function entirely as imagined,
            but to me it feels like it works well enough.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, I updated the CSS to match how the new sprites look better, as well as adding more explicit explanations of how the game works alongside proper credits.</li>
    </ul>
