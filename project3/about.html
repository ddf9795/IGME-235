    <h1>Project 3 Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Title: QUIKKSTEP</h2>
    <p>Concept: An auto-runner styled game where the player character runs from side-to-side across the horizontal plane, bouncing back in the opposite direction when they reach the 
        opposite end of the screen. The player has obstacles they are meant to dodge sent at them in the opposing direction, and the player is meant to dodge them by "quickstepping" 
        (snapping up or down to another preset y-level) out of the way. It's a high score oriented game, with a scaling difficulty method of throwing more projectiles at the player
        over time, but with increasing the score rewarded as it gets more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>Genres: Endless Runner, Action</p>
    <p>Platform: Desktop Web</p>
    <p>Story: No real story, kinda just abstract</p>
    <p>Aesthetics: Unsure yet, but maybe something super minimal and abstract and dystopian, maybe like The Cube movie from 1997 but way simpler. Just spitballing though</p>
    <p>Gameplay: The player will have no control over their horizontal movement, but will be able to control themselves on the vertical axis by snapping themselves to one of a set of
        predefined y-axes.

    <p>Other: The game will likely be made in PixiJS and HTML; unsure about the alternative of using the DOM though, I will look into it further to see what'll be best for this
        project.

    <h2>Development progress: Prototype</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The basic gameplay loop has been completed. No sound yet, and on semi-rare occasion you get a BS death, but its functional and decently fun as a little
            time waster.
        </li>
        <li>As of right now, the sprites are temporary.</li>
        <li>I also set up some basic CSS, centering it in the center of the page with a dotted border and a bit of a softer shade of very light grey as the background color.</li>
        <li>In the process of making the CSS, I got the amazing idea of making it look kinda like one of those old dot matrix games. That probably is a bit much
            to go for this late in development though. Maybe I can go for a WonderSwan look? I'll think on it.
