        "In nearly every North American Kirby release, Kirby's expression on the box cover has been changed to make Kirby look angrier. <a href='https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/nintendo-says-it-makes-kirby-angrier-for-western-box-art-139877017726.jpg/BROK/resize/1200x1200%3E/format/jpg/quality/70/nintendo-says-it-makes-kirby-angrier-for-western-box-art-139877017726.jpg' target='_blank'>(Some examples)</a>",
        "It is a common urban legend that during the development of Kirby's first game, \"Kirby\'s Dream Land,\" Shigeru Miyamoto wanted Kirby to be yellow, while Masahiro Sakurai wanted him to be pink. This is incorrect; Miyamoto was actually under the impression Kirby was yellow due to the Game Boy\'s monochrome sprites, and was pleasantly surprised when he was later on given his pink coloring.",

        "Kirby is very likely not the only one of his species; many other characters, friend and foe, are widely speculated to also be \"Kirbies\", such as Meta Knight, Galacta Knight, Morpho Knight, Zero and Zero-2, Void Termina, Prince Fluff, and the Batamon enemies from Kirby\'s Dream Land 3!",
        "Kirby can be spotted in other Nintendo franchises! Most notably, Kirby-type enemies dubbed \"Anti-Kirbies\" appear in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, wherein he inhales Link and spits him back out to attack!",
        "Some specific Kirby colors have canon names, such as yellow Kirby being named \"Keeby\"!",
        "Kirby canonically has \"infinite power\" according to his own flavor text from Kirby: Planet Robobot. It is generally understood that he could do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, but he is simply too lazy to, and chooses to eat and sleep all day instead."
